PPT OS kernel
============

There are no guide for kernel developers and users. No guide can
be rendered in any number of formats, neither HTML nor PDF. Please do
not read documentations first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make nothing`` or
``make absolutely nothing``. The formatted documentation can be 
read online at:



There is not any text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
none of them using the Human Readable Text.

Please do not read the documentation files, as it does not contain the
requirements for building or running the kernel, or information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
